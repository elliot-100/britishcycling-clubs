## [0.3.0] - 2023-09-21

- This changelog

- Documentation: Describe public functions in README 

- Dev/test dependencies: ruff

- Enforce linting with isort, black, ruff and static type checking with mypy in CI 
  using GitHub Actions

### Fixed

- Reliability issues when getting data from Club Manager pages with
 `get_private_member_counts()`. See 'Changed'

- Use of `assert` in production code

### Changed

- **BREAKING CHANGE**: Simplify package structure.
 
  `import britishcycling-clubs.main` should be replaced with `import 
  britishcycling-clubs`

- Use [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/python/) instead of Selenium when getting 
  data from Club Manager pages with `get_private_member_counts()`

  This makes deployment easier, as Playwright simplifies browser installation and
  updates, and a separate driver executable is no longer required. README updated to 
  cover this

  types-beautifulsoup4

### Removed

- Trivial test which didn't have any real value
